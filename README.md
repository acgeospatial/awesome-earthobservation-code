</p>

## This list was started based on #scenefromabove podcast lunchtime discussions
I have written a blog post about how this repo came into being. It includes a video of a talk I gave about it AND a podcast episode devoted to it. http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk/awesome-earthobservation-code/

Please note that this is <b>not</b> offically an awesome list (yet). Please help me to get it there by contributing and commenting. [guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md)

<b> Update September 2020</b> We now have over 450 links/resources! The focus is to discuss resorting and ordering all these links and potentially reclassifiying where needed many links are in the '`Python` processing of optical imagery non deep learning' section and this potentially could be broken up. Added Earth Observation introduction.

Annotations are based on the headers - where available - on the github accounts

# [Scene From Above Podcast](http://scenefromabove.org/)

</div>

Alastair Graham [@ajggeoger](https://twitter.com/ajggeoger) and Andrew Cutts [@map_andrew](https://twitter.com/map_andrew) come together to present an informal podcast [@eoscenefrom](https://twitter.com/eoscenefrom) looking at the world of modern remote sensing and EO.
Fuelled by their passion for all things raster and geospatial, the #scenefromabove podcast aims to be a mix of news, opinion, discussion and interviews. <br>

## Earth Observation Introduction

If you are not familiar with Earth Observation then these links may help set context before you start using data. I didn't initially aim at including links like these but if you are not familiar with Earth Observation then some good resources to get you going may help prior to diving into code.

- [Earth Observation Text books](https://www.eoa.org.au/earth-observation-textbooks) - Earth Observation: Data, Processing and Applications is an Australian Earth Observation (EO) community undertaking to describe EO data, processing and applications in an Australian context and includes a wide range of local case studies to demonstrate Australiaâ€™s increasing usage of EO data.
- [ESA newcomers guide](https://business.esa.int/newcomers-earth-observation-guide) - The aim of this guide is to help non-experts in providing a starting point in the decision process for selecting an appropriate Earth Observation (EO) solution.
- [The state of satellites](https://landscape.satsummit.io/) - The satellite systems we use to capture, analyze, and distribute data about the Earth are improving every day, creating bold new opportunities for impact in global development.

You may also wish to navigate a search of the terms `satellite-imagery` and `earth-observation` to get the latest list of topics that have these terms in their headers
- [satellite-imagery](https://github.com/topics/satellite-imagery)
- [earth-observation](https://github.com/topics/earth-observation)

## Open EO

OpenEO covers many of the bases, hard to know whether to break it into different categories, it has many components. At present I mention it here at the start only.<br>

- [Open EO](https://openeo.org/) - openEO develops an open API to connect `R`, `Python`, `JavaScript` and other clients to big Earth observation cloud back-ends in a simple and unified way.
- [openeo-processes](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes) - Interoperable processes for openEO's big Earth observation cloud processing [website](https://processes.openeo.org/)

## `Python` processing of optical imagery (non deep learning)
This section full of great code and projects related to processing optical satellite imagery with `Python`. This section is under review Sept 2020 and being split into further categories - please suggest groupings or re assignments if needed - the idea is to make the Python code examples here easier to find. Categories are highly subjective.

Examples come from pretty much all areas dealing with spatiotemporal data. This tutorial will go through a large number of examples to illustrate this idea, mostly focusing on the packages stars and sf and those supporting their classes (like tmap, mapview, gstat, ggplot2).

## Interesting Non EO parts other languages
This section is aimed more a data science/programming resources that 'might' be applicable to Earth Observation, that are <b>not </b>Python

- [Environmental_Intelligence](https://github.com/rockita/Environmental_Intelligence) - Data for Environmental Intelligence: A mega list of Earth System Datasets covering earth observations, climate, water, forests, biodiversity, ecology, protected areas, natural hazards, marine and the tracking of UN's Sustainable Development Goals 
- [gibs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) - This is EO

## A footnote on awesome
There are many awesome lists relating to 'Geo'. I use that term as widely as possible. This list is not meant to replace these lists. Earth Observation is still <b>way</b> behind the GIS world in terms of audience, reach, number of users etc. Things are changing though, by bringing these links together I hope you can see that there has been so much progress in the last 5 years. I do hope these links are helpful espcially to those who are new to Earth Observation, but also to people like me who with several years of experience think they may have seen it all - we haven't and there is still so much to learn. Earth Observation is not just an academic 'thing' or a basemap anymore, it forms the basis for a growing and diverse business environment. Lets embrace this.

Finally, I wanted to acknowledge a couple of awesome Earth Observation lists that you may list to check out:
